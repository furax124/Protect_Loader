# Protect Loader

## Description
Protect Loader is a shellcode loader written in pure golang designed to provide various security and evasion techniques for Go applications. It includes features such as shellcode loading, obfuscation, the use of indirect syscalls, and much more.

## Features
- **Shellcode Loading**: Secure shellcode loading using apc method.
- **GUI**: User interface created with Fyne.
- **Obfuscation**: Code obfuscation with [garble](https://github.com/burrowers/garble) with optionnaly his controlflow (need to set the environment variable `GARBLE_EXPERIMENTAL_CONTROLFLOW=1`).
- **Indirect Syscalls**: Use of indirect syscalls by [acheron](https://github.com/f1zm0/acheron) for evasion.
- **Api ashing**: [Acheron](https://github.com/f1zm0/acheron) package have a integrated api hashing for evasion
- **Bypass AMSI and EDR**: Techniques to bypass AMSI and EDR.
- **Admin Privileges Check**: Check if admin privileges are enabled.
- **Random Sleep**: Adding random delays.
- **Block Non-Microsoft DLLs**: Blocking the injection of non-Microsoft DLLs.
- **Phantom Technique**: Suspension of event logs.
- **Unhooking**: Removal of hooks for av evasion.
- **PE file To Shellcode**: The PE file is automatically transformed into a .bin using [Donut](https://github.com/TheWover/donut) and encoded using [Shikata ga nai](https://github.com/EgeBalci/sgn) and encrypted using two layer of encryption (aes and xor)
- **Key Encryption**: The key generated is encrypted using XOR to prevent his extraction

## Roadmap
- üöß = Priority Features

- [X] Create a GUI with Fyne
- [ ] Rework it to be more user-friendly (need to add option and bunch of things)
- [X] Make the code obfuscation with garble
- [X] Use indirect syscalls
- [X] Implement techniques to bypass AMSI and EDR
- [X] Check if admin privileges are enabled
- [X] Add random delays
- [X] Block the injection of non-Microsoft DLLs
- [X] Phantom technique to suspend event logs
- [X] Unhooking
- [ ] Call Stack spoofing
- [ ] Polymorphic code
- [ ] Remote shellcode to avoid detection
- [X] Encrypt XOR and AES keys in `main.go`
- [ ] Sign shellcode and loader with a certificate üöß
- [ ] Enchance the sleep duration to sleep obfuscation
- [X] Adding control flow obfuscation with [garble](https://github.com/burrowers/garble/blob/master/docs/CONTROLFLOW.md)
- [ ] Support of shellcode file (.bin)
- [ ] Anti debug/Anti vm
- [ ] Spamming of admin prompt
- [ ] Add .ico support for the generated PE file

## How to use it

- Run the GUI.bat 
- Select your PE file
- The GUI will compile it automatically (may take some time)
## Notes:
- In the GUI and subfolder there is a lot of PE file (exe) if you don't trust them,feel free to download them from their official repo.
- In complementary you can use [this](https://github.com/furax124/UPX_Compress_And_Patcher) to obfuscate the IAT table with UPX and auto patch
- ‚ö†Ô∏è‚ö†Ô∏è In order to the GUI to work correctly you need to have CGO enable (you can use [this](https://github.com/ehsan18t/easy-mingw-installer/tree/main?tab=readme-ov-file) to facilate the installation) and you will also need [Git](https://git-scm.com/downloads/win) installed
- If you want to debug make sure to remove the elevation code from main.go
- ‚ö†Ô∏è IF you want to use Control flow obfuscation you will need set the environment variable GARBLE_EXPERIMENTAL_CONTROLFLOW=1

## AV detection (may increase) as of 10/06/2025
- [VirusTotal](https://www.virustotal.com/gui/file/95955e9f5c1265638fea6eb5b0735d2566a5df69bbdb53fa4eb25b5b2aac42a8?nocache=1) as you can see even with no anti debug or anti vm. Detection rate is still good enough to be used
